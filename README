DBIx::ORM::Declarative - provides object-oriented access to a database.

DBIx::ORM::Declarative encapsulates the creation of database table classes at
compile time.  You declare the properties of table and row classes with
data structures passed to the DBIx::ORM::Declarative module when the module is

need to know a thing about SQL to create or use the classes.
